#Spidy: Spiders for the Web

##Introduction
These are just some spiders that I'm working on right nowâ€“as of now, a passing interest, but maybe it'll develop into something cool after I work with them a bit!

### Wed Nov 21
Initialized github repository, created a couple different spiders. First one simply searches for a term inside a web page's html source code, and the second goes through several layers of urls and finds other urls in them.
